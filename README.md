## ⚙️ How It Works ❓
sleep happens in cycles of approximately 90 minutes. waking up between these cycles (rather than in the middle of one) helps you feel refreshed and energized.  
**Lehaam** calculates optimal times to fall asleep and wake up for better rest.

- 90-minute sleep cycles
- 15 minutes average time to fall asleep
- Recommended 4-6 complete sleep cycles per night (6-9 hours)
